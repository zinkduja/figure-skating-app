# Follow Figure Skating!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Follow Figure Skating! app will provide figure skating fans with live updates on competitions and their favorite skaters on the go.  There are currently many apps for other sports, such as the MLB At Bat app for baseball and the NHL app for hockey.  However, despite the international success of American skaters in recent years, there is currently no app for following figure skating. A figure skating app is needed for a couple reasons. First, while there are usually live results for competitions available online, they’re not formatted well to be accessed from a phone or a tablet. Second, due to the format of figure skating competitions, it’s hard to know when exactly a certain skater will be on the ice. Thus, offering live results solves the problem of having to actively refresh live results pages to find out which skater is currently on the ice. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Follow Figure Skating! app will have users create accounts to select competitions and skaters, as well as to select which alerts they would like to receive.  The app will have all major international competitions as well as all figure skaters participating in any of these events.  Users will be able to watch progress of competitions on their phones or simply have their mobile device notify them of competition timings and individual/event results.
